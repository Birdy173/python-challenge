# python-challenge
This is my repository for the third module in my Data Analysis Boot Camp. This includes two separate folders that I created using git commands. 
PyPoll contains two folders: Resources and analysis along with my main.py code. 
The resources folder contains the CSV file I used for my analysis in Python.
The analysis folder contains a text file I outputted from my Python code.
I used my code to figure out the total number of votes, how many votes each candidate had, the percentage of their votes, and who the winner was in the poll.
PyBank contains two folders: Resources and analysis along with my main.py code. 
The resources folder contains the CSV file I used for my analysis in Python.
The analysis folder contains a text file that I outputted from my Python code.
I used my code to figure out the total number of months for banking, the net total based on profit and losses, the average change in profit and losses, the greatest increase in profits,
and the greatest decrease in profits.
